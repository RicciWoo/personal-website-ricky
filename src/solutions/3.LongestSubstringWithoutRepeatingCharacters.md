#### Problem
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

    Input: "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:

    Input: "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

    Input: "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
                 Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

#### Solution
``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        unordered_map<char, int> char2Idx;
        int last = -1, result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (char2Idx.count(s[i]) > 0) {
                last = max(last, char2Idx[s[i]]);
            }
            char2Idx[s[i]] = i;
            result = max(result, i - last);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
